## The JavaScript Universal Module & Resource Converter

Convert AMD & commonjs modules to commonjs, AMD, UMD or single `.js` and run/test on nodejs, Web/AMD or Web/Script.

All documentation is moved to the [wiki](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire/wiki) and http://urequire.org

# Some Introduction

`praise.to("Modular").forEach(['Development', 'Deployment']);`

## Why use modules like AMD, Common/JS or Harmony/ES6 ?

Write modular code, with clearly stated dependencies.

Code for humans to follow, that is maintainable & reusable.

The damnation of authoring Javascript as one huge file or concatenating must end!
Are you still concatenating .js files ?

## Why use uRequire ?

Module formats are incompatible in all terms: **syntax, execution environment, capabilities, dependency/path resolution, plugins, semantics** etc.

You want the power, goodies & standards assurance from all.

But write in just one or a **Universal Module Format**!

Be able to convert from any format, to any other.
uRequire does exactly this! If you have sensibly `define`d it, u`Require` will find it.

## What will uRequire do ?

Help you **write modular Javascript code once, run everywhere**.

Avoid boilerplate, just use the richness of modular development.

**In-memory Convert Resources**, with the 1st and only Modules & Dependencies aware builder.

Manipulate the Modules while building: **inject, remove, replace Dependencies & code**.
Voila, execute in all runtimes: **Web/Script, Web/AMD, nodejs**!

`focus.on("Da JS Code").then({convert:"anything"}).then({execute:"everywhere"});`
